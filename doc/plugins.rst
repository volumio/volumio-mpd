Plugin reference
################

.. _database_plugins:

Database plugins
================

simple
------

The default plugin. Stores a copy of the database in memory. A file is used for permanent storage.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80                     
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **path**
     - The path of the database file. 
   * - **cache_directory**
     - The path of the cache directory for additional storages mounted at runtime. This setting is necessary for the **mount** protocol command.
   * - **compress yes|no**
     - Compress the database file using gzip? Enabled by default (if built with zlib).

proxy
-----

Provides access to the database of another :program:`MPD` instance using libmpdclient. This is useful when you run mount the music directory via NFS/SMB, and the file server already runs a :program:`MPD` instance. Only the file server needs to update the database.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80                     
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **host**
     - The host name of the "master" :program:`MPD` instance.
   * - **port**
     - The port number of the "master" :program:`MPD` instance.
   * - **password**
     - The password used to log in to the "master" :program:`MPD` instance.
   * - **keepalive yes|no**
     - Send TCP keepalive packets to the "master" :program:`MPD` instance? This option can help avoid certain firewalls dropping inactive connections, at the expense of a very small amount of additional network traffic. Disabled by default.

upnp
----

Provides access to UPnP media servers.

Storage plugins
===============

local
-----

The default plugin which gives :program:`MPD` access to local files. It is used when music_directory refers to a local directory.

curl
----

A WebDAV client using libcurl. It is used when :code:`music_directory` contains a http:// or https:// URI, for example :samp:`https://the.server/dav/`.

smbclient
---------

Load music files from a SMB/CIFS server. It is used when :code:`music_directory` contains a smb:// URI, for example :samp:`smb://myfileserver/Music`.

nfs
---

Load music files from a NFS server. It is used when :code:`music_directory` contains a nfs:// URI according to RFC2224, for example :samp:`nfs://servername/path`.

This plugin uses libnfs, which supports only NFS version 3. Since :program:`MPD` is not allowed to bind to "privileged ports", the NFS server needs to enable the "insecure" setting; example :file:`/etc/exports`:

.. code-block:: none

    /srv/mp3 192.168.1.55(ro,insecure)

Don't fear: "insecure" does not mean that your NFS server is insecure. A few decades ago, people thought the concept of "privileged ports" would make network services "secure", which was a fallacy. The absence of this obsolete "security" measure means little.

udisks
------

Mount file systems (e.g. USB sticks or other removable media) using
the udisks2 daemon via D-Bus.  To obtain a valid udisks2 URI, consult
:ref:`the according neighbor plugin <neighbor_plugin>`.

It might be necessary to grant :program:`MPD` privileges to control
:program:`udisks2` through :program:`policykit`.  To do this, create a
file called :file:`/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/mpd-udisks.rules` with
the following text::

 polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
   if ((action.id == "org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount" ||
        action.id == "org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount-other-seat") &&
       subject.user == "mpd") {
       return polkit.Result.YES;
   }
 });

If you run MPD as a different user, change ``mpd`` to the name of your
MPD user.

.. _neighbor_plugin:

Neighbor plugins
================

smbclient
---------

Provides a list of SMB/CIFS servers on the local network.

udisks
------

Queries the udisks2 daemon via D-Bus and obtain a list of file systems (e.g. USB sticks or other removable media).

upnp
----

Provides a list of UPnP servers on the local network.

.. _input_plugins:

Input plugins
=============

alsa
----

Allows :program:`MPD` on Linux to play audio directly from a soundcard using the scheme alsa://. Audio is formatted as 44.1 kHz 16-bit stereo (CD format). Examples:

.. code-block:: none

    mpc add alsa:// plays audio from device hw:0,0

.. code-block:: none

    mpc add alsa://hw:1,0 plays audio from device hw:1,0 cdio_paranoia

cdio_paranoia
-------------

Plays audio CDs using libcdio. The URI has the form: "cdda://[DEVICE][/TRACK]". The simplest form cdda:// plays the whole disc in the default drive.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **default_byte_order little_endian|big_endian**
     - If the CD drive does not specify a byte order, MPD assumes it is the CPU's native byte order. This setting allows overriding this.
   * - **speed N**
     - Request CDParanoia cap the extraction speed to Nx normal CD audio rotation speed, keeping the drive quiet.

curl
----

Opens remote files or streams over HTTP using libcurl.

Note that unless overridden by the below settings (e.g. by setting them to a blank value), general curl configuration from environment variables such as http_proxy or specified in :file:`~/.curlrc` will be in effect.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **proxy**
     - Sets the address of the HTTP proxy server.
   * - **proxy_user, proxy_password**
     - Configures proxy authentication.
   * - **verify_peer yes|no**
     - Verify the peer's SSL certificate? `More information <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER.html>`_.
   * - **verify_host yes|no**
     - Verify the certificate's name against host? `More information <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST.html>`_.

ffmpeg
------

Access to various network protocols implemented by the FFmpeg library: gopher://, rtp://, rtsp://, rtmp://, rtmpt://, rtmps://

file
----

Opens local files

mms
---

Plays streams with the MMS protocol using `libmms <https://launchpad.net/libmms>`_.

nfs
---

Allows :program:`MPD` to access files on NFSv3 servers without actually mounting them (i.e. in userspace, without help from the kernel's VFS layer). All URIs with the nfs:// scheme are used according to RFC2224. Example:

.. code-block:: none

     mpc add nfs://servername/path/filename.ogg

Note that this usually requires enabling the "insecure" flag in the server's /etc/exports file, because :program:`MPD` cannot bind to so-called "privileged" ports. Don't fear: this will not make your file server insecure; the flag was named in a time long ago when privileged ports were thought to be meaningful for security. By today's standards, NFSv3 is not secure at all, and if you believe it is, you're already doomed.

smbclient
---------

Allows :program:`MPD` to access files on SMB/CIFS servers (e.g. Samba or Microsoft Windows). All URIs with the smb:// scheme are used. Example:

.. code-block:: none

    mpc add smb://servername/sharename/filename.ogg

qobuz
-----

Play songs from the commercial streaming service Qobuz. It plays URLs in the form qobuz://track/ID, e.g.:

.. code-block:: none

    mpc add qobuz://track/23601296

   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **token TOKEN**

.. _output_plugins:

Output plugins
==============

.. _alsa_plugin:

alsa
----

The `Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) <http://www.alsa-project.org/>`_ plugin uses libasound. It is recommended if you are using Linux.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **device NAME**
     - Sets the device which should be used. This can be any valid ALSA device name. The default value is "default", which makes libasound choose a device. It is recommended to use a "hw" or "plughw" device, because otherwise, libasound automatically enables "dmix", which has major disadvantages (fixed sample rate, poor resampler, ...).
   * - **buffer_time US**
     - Sets the device's buffer time in microseconds. Don't change unless you know what you're doing.
   * - **period_time US**
     - Sets the device's period time in microseconds. Don't change unless you really know what you're doing.
   * - **auto_resample yes|no**
     - If set to no, then libasound will not attempt to resample, handing the responsibility over to MPD. It is recommended to let MPD resample (with libsamplerate), because ALSA is quite poor at doing so.
   * - **auto_channels yes|no**
     - If set to no, then libasound will not attempt to convert between different channel numbers.
   * - **auto_format yes|no**
     - If set to no, then libasound will not attempt to convert between different sample formats (16 bit, 24 bit, floating point, ...).
   * - **dop yes|no**
     - If set to yes, then DSD over PCM according to the `DoP standard <http://dsd-guide.com/dop-open-standard>`_ is enabled. This wraps DSD samples in fake 24 bit PCM, and is understood by some DSD capable products, but may be harmful to other hardware. Therefore, the default is no and you can enable the option at your own risk.
   * - **allowed_formats F1 F2 ...**
     - Specifies a list of allowed audio formats, separated by a space. All items may contain asterisks as a wild card, and may be followed by "=dop" to enable DoP (DSD over PCM) for this particular format. The first matching format is used, and if none matches, MPD chooses the best fallback of this list.
       
       Example: "96000:16:* 192000:24:* dsd64:*=dop *:dsd:*".

The according hardware mixer plugin understands the following settings:

Typical values for Linux include "oss" and "alsa09". The default is "default", which causes libao to select an appropriate plugin.
   * - **options O**
     - Options to pass to the selected libao driver.
   * - **write_size O**
     - This specifies how many bytes to write to the audio device at once. This parameter is to work around a bug in older versions of libao on sound cards with very small buffers. The default is 1024.

sndio
-----

The sndio plugin uses the `sndio <http://www.sndio.org/>`_ library. It should normally be used on OpenBSD.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **device NAME**
     - The audio output device libsndio will attempt to use. The default is "default" which causes libsndio to select the first output device.
   * - **buffer_time MS**
     - Set the application buffer time in milliseconds.

fifo
----

The fifo plugin writes raw PCM data to a FIFO (First In, First Out) file. The data can be read by another program.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **path P**
     - This specifies the path of the FIFO to write to. Must be an absolute path. If the path does not exist, it will be created when MPD is started, and removed when MPD is stopped. The FIFO will be created with the same user and group as MPD is running as. Default permissions can be modified by using the builtin shell command umask. If a FIFO already exists at the specified path it will be reused, and will not be removed when MPD is stopped. You can use the "mkfifo" command to create this, and then you may modify the permissions to your liking.

haiku
-----

Use the SoundPlayer API on the Haiku operating system.

This plugin is unmaintained and contains known bugs.  It will be
removed soon, unless there is a new maintainer.


jack
----

The jack plugin connects to a `JACK server <http://jackaudio.org/>`_.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **client_name NAME**
     - The name of the JACK client. Defaults to "Music Player Daemon".
   * - **server_name NAME**
     - Optional name of the JACK server.
   * - **autostart yes|no**
     - If set to yes, then libjack will automatically launch the JACK daemon. Disabled by default.
   * - **source_ports A,B**
     - The names of the JACK source ports to be created. By default, the ports "left" and "right" are created. To use more ports, you have to tweak this option.
   * - **destination_ports A,B**
     - The names of the JACK destination ports to connect to.
   * - **ringbuffer_size NBYTES**
     - Sets the size of the ring buffer for each channel. Do not configure this value unless you know what you're doing.

httpd
-----

The httpd plugin creates a HTTP server, similar to `ShoutCast <http://www.shoutcast.com/>`_ / `IceCast <http://icecast.org/>`_. HTTP streaming clients like mplayer, VLC, and mpv can connect to it.

It is highly recommended to configure a fixed format, because a stream cannot switch its audio format on-the-fly when the song changes.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **port P**
     - Binds the HTTP server to the specified port.
   * - **bind_to_address ADDR**
     - Binds the HTTP server to the specified address (IPv4, IPv6 or local socket). Multiple addresses in parallel are not supported.
   * - **encoder NAME**
     - Chooses an encoder plugin. A list of encoder plugins can be found in the encoder plugin reference :ref:`encoder_plugins`.
   * - **max_clients MC**
     - Sets a limit, number of concurrent clients. When set to 0 no limit will apply.

null
----

The null plugin does nothing. It discards everything sent to it.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **sync yes|no**
     - If set to no, then the timer is disabled - the device will accept PCM chunks at arbitrary rate (useful for benchmarking). The default behaviour is to play in real time.

.. _oss_plugin:

oss
---

The "Open Sound System" plugin is supported on most Unix platforms.

On Linux, OSS has been superseded by ALSA. Use the ALSA output plugin :ref:`alsa_plugin` instead of this one on Linux.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **device PATH**
     - Sets the path of the PCM device. If not specified, then MPD will attempt to open /dev/sound/dsp and /dev/dsp.

The according hardware mixer plugin understands the following settings:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **mixer_device DEVICE**
     - Sets the OSS mixer device path, defaulting to /dev/mixer.
   * - **mixer_control NAME**
     - Choose a mixer control, defaulting to PCM.

openal
------
The "OpenAL" plugin uses `libopenal <http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html>`_. It is supported on many platforms. Use only if there is no native plugin for your operating system.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **device NAME**
     - Sets the device which should be used. This can be any valid OpenAL device name. If not specified, then libopenal will choose a default device.

osx
---
The "Mac OS X" plugin uses Apple's CoreAudio API.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **device NAME**
     - Sets the device which should be used. Uses device names as listed in the "Audio Devices" window of "Audio MIDI Setup".
   * - **hog_device yes|no**
     - Hog the device. This means that it takes exclusive control of the audio output device it is playing through, and no other program can access it.
   * - **dop yes|no**
     - If set to yes, then DSD over PCM according to the `DoP standard <http://dsd-guide.com/dop-open-standard>`_ is enabled. This wraps DSD samples in fake 24 bit PCM, and is understood by some DSD capable products, but may be harmful to other hardware. Therefore, the default is no and you can enable the option at your own risk. Under macOS you must make sure to select a physical mode on the output device which supports at least 24 bits per channel as the Mac OS X plugin only changes the sample rate.
   * - **channel_map SOURCE,SOURCE,...**
     - Specifies a channel map. If your audio device has more than two outputs this allows you to route audio to auxillary outputs. For predictable results you should also specify a "format" with a fixed number of channels, e.g. "*:*:2". The number of items in the channel map must match the number of output channels of your output device. Each list entry specifies the source for that output channel; use "-1" to silence an output. For example, if you have a four-channel output device and you wish to send stereo sound (format "*:*:2") to outputs 3 and 4 while leaving outputs 1 and 2 silent then set the channel map to "-1,-1,0,1". In this example '0' and '1' denote the left and right channel respectively.

       The channel map may not refer to outputs that do not exist according to the format. If the format is "*:*:1" (mono) and you have a four-channel sound card then "-1,-1,0,0" (dual mono output on the second pair of sound card outputs) is a valid channel map but "-1,-1,0,1" is not because the second channel ('1') does not exist when the output is mono.

pipe
----

The pipe plugin starts a program and writes raw PCM data into its standard input.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **command CMD**
     - This command is invoked with the shell.

.. _pulse_plugin:

pulse
-----
The pulse plugin connects to a `PulseAudio <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/>`_ server. Requires libpulse.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **server HOSTNAME**
     - Sets the host name of the PulseAudio server. By default, :program:`MPD` connects to the local PulseAudio server.
   * - **sink NAME**
     - Specifies the name of the PulseAudio sink :program:`MPD` should play on.
   * - **scale_volume FACTOR**
     - Specifies a linear scaling coefficient (ranging from 0.5 to 5.0) to apply when adjusting volume through :program:`MPD`.  For example, chosing a factor equal to ``"0.7"`` means that setting the volume to 100 in :program:`MPD` will set the PulseAudio volume to 70%, and a factor equal to ``"3.5"`` means that volume 100 in :program:`MPD` corresponds to a 350% PulseAudio volume.

recorder
--------
The recorder plugin writes the audio played by :program:`MPD` to a file. This may be useful for recording radio streams.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - **path P**
     - Write to this file.
   * - **format_path P**
     - An alternative to path which provides a format string referring to tag values. The special tag iso8601 emits the current date and time in `ISO8601 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_ format (UTC). Every time a new song starts or a new tag gets received from a radio station, a new file is opened. If the format does not render a file name, nothing is recorded. A tag name enclosed in percent signs ('%') is replaced with the tag value. Example: :file:`-/.mpd/recorder/%artist% - %title%.ogg`. Square brackets can be used to group a substring. If none of the tags referred in the group can be found, the whole group is omitted. Example: [-/.mpd/recorder/[%artist% - ]%title%.ogg] (this omits the dash when no artist tag exists; if title also doesn't exist, no file is written). The operators "|" (logical "or") and "&" (logical "and") can be used to select portions of the format string depending on the existing tag values. Example: -/.mpd/recorder/[%title%|%name%].ogg (use the "name" tag if no title exists)
   * - **encoder NAME**
     - Chooses an encoder plugin. A list of encoder plugins can be found in the encoder plugin reference :ref:`encoder_plugins`.
